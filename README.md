SOLID Principles in Java

This project demonstrates the five SOLID design principles using simple Java examples. Each principle is implemented with easy-to-understand code to show how to apply these best practices in real-world software development.

🔸 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Definition: A class should have only one reason to change.

Example:

Invoice: Manages invoice data.

InvoicePrinter: Handles printing logic.

InvoiceSaver: Handles saving logic.

✅ Each class is focused on one task only.

🔸 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Definition: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Example:

Interface: Discount

Implementations: NoDiscount, FestiveDiscount

✅ You can add new discount types without modifying existing code.

🔸 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Definition: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Example:

Sparrow extends Bird is fine.

Ostrich doesn't override fly and uses a different base (BaseBird) to follow the principle.

✅ Substitution won't break functionality.

🔸 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Definition: Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use.

Example:

Workable and Eatable interfaces.

Human implements both.

Robot only implements Workable.

✅ Avoids unnecessary method implementations.

🔸 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Example:

Interface: Database

Implementation: MySQLDatabase

DataAccess depends on Database, not a specific database class.

✅ Easily switch databases with minimal code changes.
